I am a software Engineer who is passionate about working on open-source projects, creating technology to elevate people, and building community. I love to work parallelly on multiple project and i am still on the hiest<i> ( A Tecnological hiest )</i>
ofcourse i prefer linux over Windows and it's been 3 years that i am running Arch on my system . I love to contribute to the linux comunity . 
 And most importantly i prefer tabs over spaces and vim over emacs.(I am very partial when it comes to this matter). In my free time i love drawing and ofcourse customizing my linux environment. You can have a look at my customized vim in one of the repository and also the i3wm configuration.Talking about the non-technical aspects i love listing to Rita ora and charlie puth. I love the books of Fyodor Dostoevsky. And now i write with both my hands
